      <h1>LEARNING FRENCH AT HOME, IS IT REALLY POSSIBLE?</h1>
      <p>Many people try to learn French, but get frustrated in the first few months for several reasons:</p>

          <%= image_tag "lost.png", alt: "community", width: 125 %>
          <p>Too much information on the Internet confuses them and they don't know where to start</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ksp">
          <%= image_tag "compliant.png", alt: "community", width: 125 %>
          <p>They want absolutely free courses, but you know that quality education cannot be free (it however remains accessible)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="ksp">
          <%= image_tag "tired.png", alt: "community", width: 125 %>
          <p>They don't have an effective study technique to get good results, they get demotivated and give up eventually</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>But, I can tell you that it is extremely possible to start learning French at home on the internet, and the best part is that it is simple, practical, fun and much faster than you would have ever imagined.</p>
