Bonjour <%= @user.first_name %>,


I'm Nelly, French Teacher and creator of The French Cloud!
You have just created an account on The French Cloud.

The next step to enjoy the conversation sessions and French classes?

It's without obligation and you have 10 days on "Le Curieux" to test it and see if you like it.

Still hesitating?
Then, I invite you to a free session to come and try the zoom classes with our members.
Reply me to this mail with your level so that I can send you the according zoom link.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
You are welcome even if you are a beginner :)

Bonne journée !
Nelly
